PSPPack is a PlayStation Portable executable packer / encrypter that can be used to create very small files
(like 4k or bigger intros / homebrews) compatible with PSP official firmware.<br><br>
It generates prxs based eboots, doesn't rely on pre-forged commercial games headers like other packers and is made to produce the smallest possible eboot from a given prx.<br><br>
I used it on these prods (so far):<br><br>
